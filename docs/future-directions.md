# Future Directions

\- **Classification**: Until more bowhead whale data is received, continue to develop/improve/compare classification frameworks (dictionary learning, neural networks)

\- **Accurate Labeling**: Try more different neural network(s) to accurately label the 9 key points on the whale (data augmentations, different combinations of points). We can also use **UNET** to generate a heat map and find the optimal key points
  
\- **Transfer Learning**: Continue/create experiments of deriving features of the bowhead whales through images of right whales (Does it help to include the right whales alongside the bowhead whales?)
